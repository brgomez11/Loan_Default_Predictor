Given the impact Covid-19 has had on our current environment, both socially and economically. We thought that it would be pertinent to explore alternative methods of determining credit worthiness and the ability for a borrower to repay their loan. In particular, we decided to focus on the dataset provided by the Home Credit Group. “Home Credit makes use of a variety of alternative data—including telco and transactional information—to predict their clients’ repayment abilities.” (Kaggle) Traditional methods such as the FICO score, Debt-to-income (DTI) Ratio, Collateral Value, Amount of assets, and loan conditions may not be sufficient to paint an accurate picture of a borrower’s ability to repay. (Corporate Finance Institute) Our goal is to use statistics, in particular various machine learning algorithms, to predict the ability to repay of borrowers who may not be properly represented when taking a more traditional approach. Given the breadth of features in our dataset, we capture many of the input variables and use a Principal Component Analysis to reduce the dimensionality down to the most representative for our target variable, loan repayment classification. Using these inputs, we then explore the Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Neural Networks algorithms to determine which model is best suited for our purpose.
